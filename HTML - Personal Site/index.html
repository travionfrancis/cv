      I am going to Finish my Coding lessons, get certificates, and land a Good
      Coding job. I will also learn video recording and editing by Summer 2021.
      I will learn how to drive by the end of 2020. I will move out by the age
      of 23, with addition to becoming more confident in my abilities and
      looking better. Time is on my side this time as I have very few goals so I
      will spend my time mastering them as time goes on.
